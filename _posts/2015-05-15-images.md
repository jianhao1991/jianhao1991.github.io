Eastern subtropical oceans are home to warm and bright low-level stratocumulus cloud decks. Among them, the southeast Atlantic basin presents an unique opportunity to study smoke-cloud-radiation interactions where seasonally emitted biomass burning plumes from the southern African continent are being advected over the oceanic region via the southern African Easterly Jet. In this work, I investigated how the presence of biomass burning smoke affects marine boundary layer clouds, particularly in the remote southeast Atlantic region. I demonstrated that the presence of sunlight-absorbing aerosols in the boundary layer suppress cloud water and coverage by modifying the boundary layer's thermodynamic structure and coupling state throughout the diurnal cycle.

The seasonal variation in the vertical distribution of smoke contributes to the amplification of the seasonal cycle in low-cloud fraction, with significant implications for regional climate dynamics and radiative effects.

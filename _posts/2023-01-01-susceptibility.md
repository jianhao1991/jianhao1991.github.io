Characterizing and quantifying aerosol-cloud interactions are fundamental to improving future climate projections and assessing the viability of MCB. In this work, I developed a satellite-based, bottom-up framework for deriving cloud albedo susceptibility that controls for co-varying meteorological factors. This method revealed three distinct, physically-supported susceptibility regimes, their meteorological drivers, and their spatiotemporal variability across marine low-cloud regions.

    Cloud albedo susceptibility (colored filled circles) in LWP–N<sub>d</sub> space for the NE Pacific stratocumulus deck. Size of the filled circles indicates the relative frequency of occurrence. Three susceptibility regimes are identified: (i) precipitating–brightening (light green; positive susceptibility states with effective radii greater than 12µm), (ii) entrainment–darkening (brown; negative susceptibility states and right-hand side of the EEF isoline), and (iii) Twomey–brightening (dark green; non-precipitating states with positive susceptibilities) regimes.

The findings stress the importance to consider the co-variability between cloud susceptibility and background aerosol condition in informing strategies for MCB. These findings and the framework are now widely recognized and adopted in the field.

Characterizing and quantifying aerosol-cloud interactions are fundamental to improving future climate projections and assessing the viability of MCB. In this work, I developed a satellite-based, bottom-up framework for deriving cloud albedo susceptibility that controls for co-varying meteorological factors. This method revealed three distinct, physically-supported susceptibility regimes, their meteorological drivers, and their spatiotemporal variability across marine low-cloud regions.

> The findings stress the importance to consider the co-variability between cloud susceptibility and background aerosol condition in informing strategies for MCB. These findings and the framework are now widely recognized and adopted in the field.

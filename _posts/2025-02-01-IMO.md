Ship tracks—bright, linear clouds trailing ocean-going ships—are striking manifestations of cloud adjustment in response to inadvertent aerosol perturbations from shipping emissions. Their radiative characteristics, contrasted with surrounding unperturbed scenes, offer invaluable insights into aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions. In this work, I trained ensembles of neural networks to examine how reduced pollution from shipping affects cloud properties and climate. The results reveal that while the IMO2020 regulation brings significant environmental and public health benefits, it also produces a global warming effect of approximately 0.1 W m<sup>−2</sup>, equivalent to about 3.5 years of CO<sub>2</sub> warming. We concluded that even this substantial, abrupt radiative forcing is challenging to detect, underscoring the difficulty of observing real-world cloud adjustments against natural cloud variability.
